The original artworks are done with acrylic paints directly on the surface of the map. They are available for purchase, each individually priced (unless specified as *sold*). The sizes vary slightly, depending on the map, but are about A3. 

I have limited edition, signed prints of all the pieces available at **R400** each. I can ship around South Africa, for the added price of postal, if you're not based in or near to Cape Town, as I am.

I also do commissions and find this is a really fun way to bring your experiences of an area to life, whether with a single species or several mapped out over an area, show casing your unique memories of a place, as captured by its local flora and fauna.

Do get in touch with me for any of the above.
