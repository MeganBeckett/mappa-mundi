Swimming down the warm, tropical east coast, Regal Angelfish are some of my favourite coral reef inhabitants to see whilst diving, especially at Sodwana Bay for their striking stripes and incandescent colours.

Sodwana Bay is situated in the Maputaland Marine Protected area and is one of the world’s premier scuba diving and snorkelling destinations with some 35 000 scuba divers visiting per year. The 50 km reef complex is Africa’s southernmost coral reef - home to a wide diversity of resident and migratory species and is well known for endangered megafauna - let’s keep it that way.
