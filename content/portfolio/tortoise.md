The beautifully patterned Geometric tortoise is one of the rarest tortoise species in the world and is classified as critically endangered. There are only 3 populations left, restricted to renosterveld pockets in the south western part of the Western Cape, including Ceres and the Tulbagh-Worcester valley, shown on the map here.

The agriculture and urban development of the renosterveld are the major factors responsible for the massive decline in their numbers. This destruction of renosterveld has reduced the habitat of Geometric tortoises to less than 3% of its original size.
