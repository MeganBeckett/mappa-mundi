Celebrating the Pride of Table Mountain, the endemic Red Disa. Relatively rare this bright flower is the floral emblem to the Western Cape and always a pleasure to see. 

<!--more-->
If youâ€™re out running or hiking on Table Mountain during the summer months, make sure you stop to look for this beautiful, vibrant orchid near waterfalls, streamlets and damp areas, particularly on the Back Table (with the Aquaduct, Window Gorge, and Myburghs Waterall offering some of the best spots).

Did you know its pollination is one of the most complex of all orchids, involving the mountain pride butterfly, *Aeropetes tulbaghia*? The butterfly is very strongly attracted to the colour red and will even be attracted to a red hiking bag or socks as much as to the flower.

#### *Disa uniflora*
