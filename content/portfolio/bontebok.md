Did you know that the Bontebok came near to extinction due to European settlement and hunting in the early 19th century? They were thought of as pests and killed extensively.

Fortunately, an isolated population was protected on a private farm. Then, in 1931, 17 members of this population were translocated to establish Bontebok National Park, where their numbers started to recover.

Bontebok National Park is the smallest of South Africa’s 20 national parks, and can only support about 200 bontebok. Over the years, the park’s surplus have been translocated elsewhere, and there are now about 2500-3000 individuals worldwide, all derived from the original 17.
