Formerly known as ‘Jackass’ Penguins, (if you’ve ever heard their bray you’ll know why!), these little chaps are the only penguin species found on our continent - hence they are now officially known as the African Penguin.

Endemic to the coastal waters of southern Africa, they mostly live in colonies on 24 islands between Namibia and Algoa Bay near Port Elizabeth. In South Africa, there are only two land-based colonies: at Boulders Beach in Simon’s Town and Stony Point Penguin Colony in Betty’s Bay, both shown on the map in the painting. The African Penguin is monogamous and pairs, as the two in the painting, return to the same breeding site each year.

African Penguins are currently regarded as vulnerable to extinction. But, their populations are starting to grow again thanks to the conservation efforts of our nature reserves, marine protected areas and SANCCOB, the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds. 

SANCOB is internationally recognised for the role it played during the *MV Treasure* oil spill when more than 20 000 African penguins were oiled when the ship sank between Robben Island and Dassen Island.
