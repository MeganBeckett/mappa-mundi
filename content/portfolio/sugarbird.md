The Cape Sugarbird, perched here on an Orange Pincushion, is one of six bird species endemic to the Fynbos biome.

In both sexes the undertail is bright yellow, but a striking feature of this little bird if that the male has a very long tail, twice the length of its body. 

For me, they are particularly associated with strolling through the botanical gardens, specifically Kirstenbosch in Cape Town and Harold Porter in Betty's Bay, and seeing them flit from one pincushion to the next, with their tales flowing elegantly behind.
