The collective noun for a group of meerkats is a "mob" or a "gang". Very aptly named as there are few animals on Earth who work as well together as meerkats!

They are very social creatures and live in colonies together, making large underground networks with multiple entrances - crucial for a quick dash away from predators when the meerkat performing sentry duty gives the shrill warning bark. 

Even though it can get incredibly hot in the Kalahari and Karoo, it can still get chilly in winter. To help warm up, meerkats have only a thin layer of fur on their bellies, which they turn towards the sun to absorb the warm rays on a chilly winterâ€™s morning, as this this family group is doing here, surveying their kingdom in the Karoo.
