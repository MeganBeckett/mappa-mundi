Historically, Cape Mountain Zebra occurred throughout the montane regions of the Cape, but after almost being driven to extinction, they are now classified as vulnerable and occur in only a few of our national parks, mainly Mountain Zebra National Park in the Eastern Cape (top right of map).

They are the smallest of the zebra subspecies and the most geographically restricted. Distinguishable with their white underbellies and a striking, characteristic grid pattern on the backs. They also don't have the "shadow stripes" seen in the common plains Zebra.
