On the alert, a Cape Clawless Otter checking out its surroundings before it slips back into the water.

<!--more-->

Cape Clawless Otters are one of 4 otter species that inhabit both fresh and marine water ecosystems. Their front feet are adapted for digging and therefore donâ€™t have claws (giving them their name) while their hind feet are partly webbed with 3 claws on each feet.

Despite being fairly widely distributed, they particularly elusive, and it is always a treat to spot one and observe their playful nature, whether you're out on a kayak in Table Bay or hiking along the Otter Trail of the Garden Route.
