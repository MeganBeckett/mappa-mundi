The Blue Crane, our national bird of South Africa, is endemic to southern Africa, with 99% of the population occurring within our borders. 
<!--more-->

The species name comes from the Latin word, *paradiseus*, meaning ‘paradise - possibly referring to their almost angelic appearance?  It is the world’s most restricted crane and unfortunately, they are losing their paradise and numbers are declining, due to habitat loss, poisoning and powerline collision.
