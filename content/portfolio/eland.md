The eland is a sight to behold, and for me, they are particularly associated with the slopes of the Drakensberg Mountains.

Perhaps as they echo the regal, magnificent nature of their surroundings, and their presence is etched in stone with ancient pigment at many sites, telling stories of hunting, fighting, feasting and daily life for the bushmen.

Some 20 000 individual rock paintings have been recorded at 500 different cave and overhang sites along the Drakensberg range. The subject matter ranges from humans to other animals, most of which are eland.The Khoi San people believe in many deities, however the praying mantis and the eland are held in the highest regards. The eland formed part of many of their rituals and traditions. When shamans painted an eland, they didn’t just pay homage to a sacred animal; they also harnessed its essence. They put paint to rock and opened portals to the spirit world.  It’s a magical animal.
